# US Economic Data Project
Aggregation and Display of Broad Based of US Economic Indicators

## Overview
The US Economic Data Project is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for aggregating, structuring, and visualizing a broad range of US economic indicators. By organizing macroeconomic data into a clear hierarchical structure, this project provides an intuitive way to track trends, compare data points, and analyze economic conditions in real time and historically. Whether you are an economist, investor, policymaker, or researcher, this repository aims to streamline economic data analysis by centralizing key indicators and automating data updates from multiple sources.


## Project Goals
###  ‚úî  Organize US economic data into a structured hierarchy, beginning with Real Economic Activity and Prices.
###  ‚úî  Aggregate macroeconomic indicators using a structured data hierarchy from reliable public sources (FRED, BEA, BLS, Census Bureau).
###  ‚úî  Visualize economic drivers and relationships in an interactive dashboards.
###  ‚úî  Automate updates for real-time data tracking, ensuring that users always have access to the latest insights.


## Data Hierarchy
This project structures economic data into two primary branches:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Real Economic Activity 

Real economic activity captures the overall level of goods and services generated within an economy, reflecting the breadth and intensity of economic activity across industries, regions, and labor markets. It encompasses business output, industrial production, consumer and business activity, and supply chain dynamics, providing a comprehensive view of economic momentum. By analyzing trends in production, resource utilization, and demand conditions, we can assess the underlying strength of economic expansion, sectoral shifts, and cyclical patterns that drive long-term growth and short-term fluctuations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Prices

The Prices category reflects the evolving cost dynamics across the economy, capturing the forces that shape consumer purchasing power, business expenses, and investment decisions. It includes both price expectations‚Äîwhich influence financial markets, wage negotiations, and corporate pricing strategies‚Äîand realized prices, which reflect the actual movement of costs across goods, services, wages, and input materials. By analyzing pricing pressures across different sectors, supply chains, and global trade channels, this category helps identify inflationary trends, cost-push pressures, and shifts in economic sentiment that impact households, businesses, and policymakers.
